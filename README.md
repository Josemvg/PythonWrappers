# Python Wrappers
Welcome to the Python Wrappers repository! This educational resource is designed to help you understand and utilize the power of wrappers in Python.

## What are Wrappers?
Wrappers are functions or classes that wrap around other methods, allowing you to modify or extend their behavior. They provide a layer of abstraction that enhances code reusability, readability, and maintenance. By using wrappers, you can add consistent functionality to multiple parts of your codebase without duplicating code.

## Why Use Wrappers?

+ Modularity: Wrappers allow you to modularize your code, making it easier to manage and maintain.
+ Consistency: They help enforce consistent behaviors across different parts of your codebase.
+ Code Reusability: Wrappers enable you to reuse common functionality without rewriting it.
+ Debugging and Monitoring: Wrappers can provide insights into code execution, making debugging and monitoring more efficient.

## Examples

Now, let's take a look at the type of wrappers we'll cover in this repository:

1. Error Handling Wrapper: Handling errors gracefully is crucial for maintaining the reliability of your applications. The Error Handling Wrapper helps you catch and manage exceptions, preventing crashes and providing meaningful error messages.
2. Timing Wrapper: The Timing Wrapper allows you to measure the execution time of functions or code blocks.
3. Logging Wrapper: Effective logging enhances your ability to monitor and troubleshoot applications.
4. Retry Wrapper: In a distributed and sometimes unreliable environment, retrying failed operations can prevent service disruptions. The Retry Wrapper automates the process of retrying failed functions.
